# supersingular
These files contain some simple verifications of supersingularity
of some curves in *[Explicit supersingular cyclic curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14902)*
by Marco Streng.

The algorithms are not the most efficient, so if you want to
do something with larger primes or larger sets of curves,
then you may want to look elsewhere.

See the file supersingular.sage for how to use the code
and for what it checks.

To run all the verifications automatically, use:

    sage -t supersingular.sage

It was tested with SageMath version 10.2.
